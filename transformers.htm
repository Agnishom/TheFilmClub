<h1 class="heading">Transformers: The Age of Extinction</h1>
<div class="firstPar"><p>
<strong>Directed by Michael Bay. Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz, Stanley 
  Tucci, Kelsey Grammer, Jack Reynor, T.J. Miller, Bingbing Li. 12A cert, 165

<p>
In Hollywood last week, the skies darkened, the streams ran bitter and a green 
  haze rose from the soil. Strange creatures slunk from the woods, their 
  laughter borne on a foul-smelling wind, and danced horribly while the moon 
  was gibbous. 
</p></div><div class="thirdPar">
<p>
And close to the hour of midnight, the wise men consulted their books, and 
  asked what the meaning of these baleful signs could be. And then their eyes 
  fell on the following words, scratched by ancient hands in a spidery script: 
  &ldquo;Michael Bay has used a metaphor.&rdquo; 
</p></div><div class="fourthPar">
<p>
The new Transformers <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/">film</a></strong>, 
  which contains robots that turn into dinosaurs and a weapon that makes 
  people explode, freeze and burst into flames all at the same time, begins 
  with something that is &ndash; and there is no other word for it &ndash; clever. 
</p></div>
<p>
It&rsquo;s a funny, throwaway sequence about the state of the movies, and it 
  suggests that Bay, the director of four Transformers films, Pearl Harbor and 
  Armageddon, and a man credited more often with killing popular cinema than 
  any other filmmaker working today, is ready to fight for his place in the 
  pantheon. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9853374/Mark-Wahlberg-Im-not-the-same-thrill-seeker.html">Mark 
  Wahlberg</a></strong> plays Cade Yeager &ndash; Cade Yeager! &ndash; a Texan inventor who&rsquo;s 
  always on the lookout for scrap he can refit and tart up. He goes into a 
  derelict cinema (&ldquo;Thanks for 79 great years!&rdquo;, reads the marquee) and 
  discovers a battered truck inside, caked in plaster, dusty but salvageable. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The movies nowadays,&rdquo; shrugs the theatre&rsquo;s owner, who&rsquo;s in his 70s &ndash; and, we 
  soon learn, senile and incontinent. &ldquo;Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap. I 
  liked this one,&rdquo; he adds, waving at a poster for Howard Hawks&rsquo; El Dorado &ndash; 
  which is, as Bay well knows, itself a remake. But Cade sees potential in the 
  wreckage, and spends his last few dollars on the truck &ndash; which turns out, of 
  course, to be a Transformer, and their ticket to excitement and glamour. But 
  when he drives it home, his 17-year-old daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) is 
  dismayed. Cade says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you to look at the junk and see the 
  treasure.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>
Transformers: Age of Extinction is unabashed junk, but when historians dig it 
  up it in hundreds of years, they&rsquo;ll find much of value. Bay is openly 
  positioning his film &ndash; his entire method and aesthetic, really &ndash; as the only 
  hope for cinema&rsquo;s survival in the era of the box-set and video-game. 
</p>
<p>
In a sense, he&rsquo;s right to do so: there are scenes in his latest film that 
  simply can&rsquo;t be understood, let alone enjoyed, on a screen less than 30 feet 
  tall and without speakers on all sides, giving your eyeballs and eardrums an 
  ecstatic pulverising. 
</p>
<p>
But there&rsquo;s a conversation with America&rsquo;s movie culture going on here, too: 
  most conspicuously with the Monument Valley of John Ford&rsquo;s westerns, which 
  Bay uses as a hideout for the heroic Autobots, but also with the open roads 
  of Monte Hellman and Dennis Hopper, the fractured families of <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/9872771/Steven-Spielberg-on-his-28-films-from-Duel-to-Lincoln.html">Steven 
  Spielberg</a></strong>, and the golden plains of Terrence Malick, all of which 
  appear &ndash; refitted and tarted up &ndash; in Bay&rsquo;s movie. 
</p>
<p>
Age of Extinction never comes close to touching those directors&rsquo; best work, 
  and spends much time grubbing around many miles below their worst, but it&rsquo;s 
  at least goofily conscious of them, and brazen enough to identify itself as 
  the next step. 
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s not much to report re: plot. A corrupt government agent (Kelsey 
  Grammer) colludes with a technology mogul (Stanley Tucci) to build an army 
  of controllable Transformers using a special space metal that&rsquo;s truly and 
  honestly called Transformium. A hitch: some lumps of leftover Decepticon are 
  stirred into the mix, and the army turns sentient and evil.
