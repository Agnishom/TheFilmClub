<h2>Transformers: The Age of Extinction</h2>
<p>
In Hollywood last week, the skies darkened, the streams ran bitter and a green 
  haze rose from the soil. Strange creatures slunk from the woods, their 
  laughter borne on a foul-smelling wind, and danced horribly while the moon 
  was gibbous. 
</p>
<p>
And close to the hour of midnight, the wise men consulted their books, and 
  asked what the meaning of these baleful signs could be. And then their eyes 
  fell on the following words, scratched by ancient hands in a spidery script: 
  &ldquo;Michael Bay has used a metaphor.&rdquo; <a href='transformers.htm'>Read the full review</a>

<h2>Tare Zamin Par</h2>
AND we thought only Iranian filmmakers understood that Children were of and from Heaven. But that's because Iranian cinema is replete with delightful, soul-stirring insights into all that's wrong in the adult world, through the unaltered vision of a child. 
<br> <br> Kudos to Aamir Khan for proving us wrong by giving us a brilliant dekko into the mysterious, magical mind of a child who really doesn't know why befuddled adults are hell-bent on mutilating everything's that beautiful, innocent, free and fulsome...All because they feel there is no </span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;"> faayda </span> (profit) in it. 
<br> <br> Ostensibly, the film is about children with special needs and the story revolves around the efforts of a dyslexic child to fit in, adjust and perform in a 'normal' world where competition is the norm and regimentation the principle. 
<br> <br> A world where it is natural and 'normal' to rap eight-year-old knuckles and discipline with verbal abuse and physical battering, if a child gets his spellings wrong, forgets to do his homework or fails to give a copy book answer. But the canvas of the film is so sensitive, so vast, so meaningful, it includes any and every child in its ambit. <a href='tzp.htm'>Read the full review</a>

<h2>The Beautiful Mind</h2>
<p>
What's the point of having a mathematical genius in a film if he isn't (a) barking, and (b) adorable underneath? Or, to put it the other way round, what's the point of having a schizophrenic in a film if he's not a mathematical genius - or some kind of genius?
</p>
<p>
Ron Howard's plodding, pedestrian hagiography of troubled mathematician John Nash - who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia but went on to win the Nobel prize - is taken straight from Dryden's maxim about great wits being sure to madness near allied. It is also a gruesome example of the lie-opic, or lie-ography, in that it coyly excises the gay episodes in the real Nash's life - in particular his arrest for importuning in a public lavatory. <a href='beautiful.htm'>Read the full review</a>

<h2>Three Idiots</h2>
<p>A comedy about three college buddies that doesn't let its more serious theme of "self-actualization" get in the way of the entertainment, "3 Idiots" takes a while to lay out its game plan but pays off emotionally in its second half. Quality mainstream item from producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and helmer Rajkumar Hirani, best known for their 2003 hit "Munna Bhai MBBS," comes laden with must-see smarts, especially super-choosy star Aamir Khan ("Lagaan"). Crossover potential is zero, but the Dec. 23 release should score some intelligent numbers among Indian auds at home and abroad over the year-end frame.</p>
<p>Script is loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's 2004 bestseller, "Five Point Someone," first published in English and later translated into Hindi. But where Bhagat's novel focused entirely on the college-exam anxieties and romantic antics of three student friends, "3 Idiots" expands the material into a tale of almost epic proportions, as two pals set out on a journey to find the third who influenced their lives so much at university 10 years earlier.<a href='3idiots.htm'>Read the full review</a></p>

<h2>Captain Phillips</h2>
<p>Two things about this riveting dramatisation of a real-life hijacking from 2009 tell you that you're watching a Paul Greengrass film. First, there is the urgent handheld camerawork, a directorial trademark refined and perfected by cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, which lends an air of pseudo-documentary authenticity to carefully staged reconstructions, putting us right there in the huddle of the action.</p>
<p>Then there is the wider perspective. While the title namechecks the American sea captain upon whose book this movie is partly based, our first encounter with the young Somalis who chase and board the gigantic Maersk Alabama is on the shores of their homeland, delving (briefly but significantly) into the poverty that drives fishermen to risk life and limb in pursuit of deep sea big game. For all its action aesthetics and nail-biting, gut-wrenching tension, this is on some level a film about globalisation, about what happens when the paths of the very poor and the very rich intersect in the crossfire of world economics.<a href='phillips.htm'>Read the full review</a></p>
